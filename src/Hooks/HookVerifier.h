// Runtime verification of a hook target against the committed table.
//
// Everything here is deliberately platform-neutral and expressed against a
// TargetResolver, so the whole verifier is exercised off-game on Linux and
// Windows by feeding it synthetic bytes (match, single-byte mismatch, truncated
// read, unresolvable id, missing entry). The Windows build supplies a resolver
// backed by REL::RelocationID + the mapped image; the tests supply a fake.
//
// What it proves: the running SkyrimSE.exe is the build this revision was
// verified against, and the function about to be hooked is still the function
// the table describes - and, for a virtual target, that the vtable slot still
// points at it.
//
// What it does NOT prove: semantics. A hook can sit at the right address with
// the right prologue and still be wrong for our purpose (the GMemoryHeapPT
// argument count had to come from disassembly precisely because the header
// comment order was wrong, and no signature check would have caught that).
